This is an introductory course in programming and data processing. This course teaches important
concepts about programming blocks, algorithms, and data structures using python. More than
teaching you how to program in python, this course teaches programming fundamentals that can
be used to implement code in python or any other programming language. Moreover, this course
teaches how to design, implement, and evaluate programming solutions to business problems.
Furthermore, this course offers an introduction to the processing of data in multiple formats (e.g.,
plain files, comma separated values). This is a programming course. Therefore, in this course,
coding, debugging, and improving code are central to students’ learning.
