This course is designed to introduce undergraduate students to the integrated nature of security in a number of different contexts. In this course students learn about environmental, technical (computer science/cybersecurity), historical, ethical, social, political, and business and economics. This course leverages a case-study approach that delves into the different contexts of security environments while providing, where possible, hands-on exercises, simulations and discussions.
